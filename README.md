My first html project

<!-- Use it to review the progress at the end  -->

I tried to complete the project in a nice time while practicing all the tags that I've learnt (maybe just not the strong one). It's going easy until now, obviously that's just my first step, and I'm looking forward to learn more with The Odin Project :D
